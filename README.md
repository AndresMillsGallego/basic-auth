# Basic-Auth

This week we are implementing authorization into our apps.  Supposedely when we get into the wild a lot of this will be automated, but it is fun to learn it all from scratch.

## Usage

A good introduction to the inner workings of sequelize, postgres and how to create and use the database.  To add to this, we are working on implementing authorzation into our apps, so that only an authorized user can access their account / db.

## Features / Routes

I used `sequelize`, `postgres`, `express`, `jest` to build and test this app.  It is a **REST** app and uses `GET`, `PUT`, `POST` and `DELETE` routes.  These are all used in separate Router files for each model.

For authentication I used `base64` and `bcrypt`
